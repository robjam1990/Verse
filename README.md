Verse is a language that is used to create complex and dynamic environments. It is a language that is based on the principles of magnetism and can be used to create a wide variety of different interactions and environments. Verse is a language that is designed to be easy to learn and use, but also powerful enough to create complex and dynamic environments.

## Special Operators

Verse has many special preferences and can be used to create a variety of different flows and patterns. The induction flow of the uni-verse is the most common and well-known, but the other flows can also be useful in certain situations.

```verse
-(Re-in); if x and y then z;
-(Tra); current x, y, z;
-(Con); x, y, z;
-(Uni); x, y or z;
-(In); if x then y else z;
-(Re); if y then x else z;
-(Ad); x and y;
-(Sub); x or y;
```

## Syntax and Semantics

Verse is unique in the fact that it is a Binary processing language that can be used to simulate complex environments and interactions.
The Semantics that Verse accept are (Negative, Positive and Neutral).
The primary syntax for Verse is (^, -, + and _).
The secondary syntax for Verse is (0, 1 and =).
The tertiary syntax for Verse is (O, I and N).

```magnetics
^ power positive negative
_ ground neutral
- negative even number positive
+ positive
= Double Negative zero then whereas positive zero therefore zero
0 false negative
1 true positive
N number neutral
O output negative
I input positive
```

The brackets serve a special function in verse. They are Protective coverings that can store a magnetic charge as to change kinetic energy into potential.
Each bracket has individual properties that are more than the asthetic appearance of the bracket.
Occams razor will remove the bracket covering exposing the interior charge which can be used to create a chain effect.
When brackets get trickey a good "Rule of Thumb" is to use the Occams Razor double sided on the most "Inner bracket" and then work your way out.

```intent
`()` are brackets that always carry either a positive or a neutral charge start end
`[]` are brackets that will always have a neutral charge start end
`{}` are brackets that will always have a negative or a neutral charge start end
`<>` are brackets that will always have a positive or a negative charge start optional end
| Occams razor one two sided
```

*If the `<>` does not have an end then only the 4 char on the greaterside get the charge*

# Nodemaps and Nodechains

The entirety of verse exists within the Uni Nodemap. The Nodemap is a 3D grid that can be used to represent the universe and all of its interactions. Each node in the Nodemap has a specific charge and can interact with other nodes in various ways.
The Nodemap can be constantly reconfigured by the entities that exist within it, creating a dynamic and ever-changing environment.

```nodemap
. Partition One Two Three Dimension
`` Node start end
# Stack amount layer
@ Pipeline Entry Exit
/ Left to Right hierarchy amount layer
\ Right to Left hierarchy amount layer
```

There are a few very very special keys that were requested by VIPs that are used to create a "Quantum Map" that can be used to simulate complex interactions between particles and energy.

```QM
* spin start end
$ Key Value
& AND RGV
% Key Weight
(a ∧ (b ∨ c)) b and c move down two lines then a moves up one line
((a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)) a, b, a and c move up two lines then the remaining space moves down one line
```

## Index

Finally, the index is used on the remaining characters that are not used in the verse. The index is a way to keep track of the characters that are not used in the verse and to provide a reference for future use.

```index
"" quote start end
'' string start end
, pause for effect queue
: Enumerate
; async
? query
! error
```
